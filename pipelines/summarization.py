          "positions in U.S. companies so far this year, data from financial data analytics firm Ortex showed on " \
          "Thursday. The hefty losses come as shares of highly-shorted GameStop jumped more than 1,000% in the past " \
          "week without a clear business reason, forcing short-sellers to buy back into the stock to cover potential " \
          "losses -- defined as a short-squeeze -- while retail investors then piled in to benefit from the surge. " \
          "Chasing shorted companies became a trend among retail traders, rippling across U.S. markets and Europe. " \
